      <p>Hey! My name is Jonathan James and I am an event photographer and an aspiring software engineer based out of Portland, OR. I am currently studying front-end web development via Launchcode.com&#39;s &quot;LC101&quot; class. Prior to this class I
        have played around with coding a little here and there since 2013 but started taking it seriously in September of 2016. I live a rather minimalistic lifestyle and I enjoy carrying over these principles into the code that I write and want to continue
        to incorporate this theme into websites that I will build in the near future. I am a firm believer in &quot;less is more&quot;. Software development is attractive to me because of all of the opportunities that come with knowing how to read and
        write code, while also having the freedom to create projects not only for clients, but for myself with my own ideas and aspirations.
